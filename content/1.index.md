## About me

#introduction
My name is Miguel, I'm a `25&#x60; Software Engineer based in ***Spain*** that is currently working at [*Cívica*](https://civica-soft.com), a Spanish Software Consultancy Company.

#work
I'm currently working as a `Full-stack/Cloud Developer`, asisting clients with infra-structure support, software maintenance and Technical supervision.

I've worked with multiple technologies in different departments, from ***Azure Logic Apps*** to ***Biztalk Server*** XML Mapper in the cloud department,
from ***VueJS*** to ***Astro*** in the Front-end Department and from ***LaravelPHP*** to ***Java & Spring*** in the back-end.

I always try to remain "Tecnology Agnostic", trying to find challenging projects with tecnologies i don't know about, to learn
the most i can so i can make better decisions in the future.
